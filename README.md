- `arc`: not yet uploaded, various projects which work with/operate on logs [some also operate on other spin.systems components but increasingly I'm placing these elsewhere]
  - may upload some selectively in future
- `log`: stores logs, which are at various locations in [spin.systems](http://spin.systems)-associated repositories [all hosted on GitHub using repo wikis allowing for online and offline editing/viewing]
  - only `src` directories have been uploaded, since the `log` content
    exist as submodules [other repos]
